        <h4>Dance and Memory</h4>

        <par>Since I was young, I have always been drawn to dance. The movement and music always helped improve my mood. 
            For most people dance is a carefree activity one does for fun. For me, dance was a competitive sport. 
            competitive dance was very challenging and required a ton of memorization. From the age of 6, I had to memorize a 
            range of 4 to eventually 10 dances. These dances were all 3 minutes long and were a range of different styles of dance.
            The variety of the style also made it challenging to memorize. However, as I grew up and become more praticed at dance I found it easier to memorize and perfect the dances. 
            my body learned how to do muscle memory. This comes with lots of practice and repition. It is not an easy thing to do. I have found though
            that through dance I have an easier time remembering information after only seeing it a few times. 
            I also have found i understand the information at a faster rate then other people. This comes from learning ten dances in 3 months 
            and then competing them on stage. Dance has taught my brain to pick up small amount of material at a faster pace.

            On the day to day many people struggle with there mental health. This is not an uncommon thing.
            The world can be a stressful and unkind place. Many people can handle pushing aside their emotions but 
            for most people dealing with them can be more productive in the long run. 
            For myself, I find that there are a few things I can do everyday or every week that can improve the state of my mind.
            one of them is any form of exercise. This could include a long walk with a friend, dance party in my room, a jog around the block,
            or even just some stretching. Anything that gets your blood pumping and working is good for the mind. I get some much needed fresh air 
            and a break away from the screens my life seems to revolve around. 
            other than exercise, I find that reading and writing greatly improves my mood. Just a 30 minute break away from reality would do anyone some good.
            Also do enough activities every day so your brain feels like it has done enough. I sleep better at night knowing that I did all i could for that day.
            Cleaning and keeping my space neat also greatly increases my mental health.
